# CHIRON
A series of C++ programs for chiral perturbation theory

This is the program collection CHIRON of programs for Chiral perturbation
theory at two loops.

It includes a set of numerical utility programs put together in a library
called libjbnumlib.a and a number of functions needed for mesonic ChPT at
two loop level as libchiron.a
