This is the program collection CHIRON of programs for Chiral perturbation
theory at two loops.

It includes a set of numerical utility programs put together in a library
called libjbnumlib.a and a number of functions needed for mesonic ChPT at
two loop level. Have a look at the various include files to see what is
inside. The included LaTeX documentation is normally far behind.
The filelist.txt should give some information on what is included as well.

When you have unpacked chironxxx.tar.gz you should have a directory
called chironxxx in the place where you unpacked.
The subdirectories are: include src test testoutputs

From the Makefile:

produce the jbnumlib library using
"make libjbnumlib.a"
and the chiron library using
"make libchiron.a"
or both using
"make"

a number of example and testing programs are include in the subdirectory test
these can normally be produced by using
"make testyyyyy"
and then running with ./a.out

yyyyy stands for sunsetintegrals in the case of testsunsetintegrals.cc
and similarly for the others

Programs should work with any up-to-date C++ compiler but have only been
tested with g++ under Linux, the same goes for the Makefile
