to oneloopintegrals.h and testoneloopintegrals.cc
B21b,B32b added to quenchedoneloopintegrals.cc and small changes
to quenchedoneloopintegrals.h and testquenchedoneloopintegrals.cc

160603

160621
The tadpole with twisted boundary conditions added and to the manual

160705
AbVtwistt, BbVtwistt cases with three momenta on top added
somewhat simpler interface added for the twisted cases as well

160708
jbdadmul, jbdad2, jbdad3 error switched to absolute below 1 and relative
above one, now same as the one dimensional ones

161004
added the values at qsq=0 for B31b and B32b standard propagators
added the values at qsq=0 for B1b,B21b,B22b,B31b,B32b also for the
  quenched integrals cases 2 and 3

161012
fixed a bug in B33 at finite volume

171026
added version with a void pointer to jbdquad15,jbdquad21

171108
jbdli2, jbdli3, jbdli4 added as generalized polylogarithms and previous jbdli2
renamed jbdli2p

171129
added version with a void pointer to jbwquad15,jbwquad21

180228
added version with a void pointer to jbdad2,jbdad3,jbdadmul

190220
Small typo fixed in section ChPT
inputsnf2 added everywhere
li.h li.cc testli.cc testli.dat added and in manual

190221
Mass, decay and vev added in physical mass for NLO 2-flavour ChPT as files
and in manual infinite and finite volume

190408
jbdzerox added as files and in manual

190416
Mass and decay in physical mass for NNLO 2-flavour ChPT as files
and in manual: finite volume

210211
filenames li.cc, li.h, testli.cc, testli.dat changed everywhere to include
nf2, many mac people had problems with the system treating li.cc and Li.cc ...
as the same files

210312
added version with void pointer to jbdgauss, jbdgauss2,jbwgauss, jbwgauss2
the sunsetintegrals valid below threshold now only have the precision as
a global variable, should be threadsafe for most applications.

210419
added the finite volume p^6 functions also as overall quantities
(were in .h file and in manual but not in .cc file)

221020
added jbdPlm and jbdYlm to jbnumlib (associated Legendre polynomials and
spherical harmonics)
added += and -= to fourvector.h and fourvector.cc
added a complex version of jbdadmul with the extra pointer

To be done:
f_+ for partially quenched staggered case to manual
changes in fourvector to manual
B31b,B32b to manual, both quenched and unquenched, and finite volume with twist
jbdPlm and jbdYlm to manual
